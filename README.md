# What is it?
This is a tool to be used with Sillica's Unity Tools and unity for quickly installing unity games for the vita over FTP.
This tool is based off of a program made my Jordi at jllopisol@gmail.com. This program wouldn't be possible without his work so if you like this program consider donating to him via paypal at:

This program also uses Sillica's UnityTools for building the game and this wouldn't be possible without it either.
This ALSO uses WinSCP to transfer files and commands over FTP so credit goes to those guys as well.

# How to use: 
1. Download and extract the Tools.zip folder from the releases
2. Copy the Editor folder to your assets folder.
3. Change the values in the script in the Editor folder to match your vita's
4. Copy the Uploader folder to the root of your project directory (So thats the parent directory of the Assets folder).
5. Make sure your vita has FTP enabled weather it's via Vitashell or some other plugins. I recommend using this plugin by Teakhanirons called FTPanywhere so you wont need to open up vitashell all the time.
6. Try to build like normal and sit back and relax.

# Known issues:
1. USB mode currently doesn't work properly. The VPK doesn't get installed and the rest of the files are copied.
2. Works on some systems and not on others. A patch should be released soon for this.
